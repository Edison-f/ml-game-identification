# Project Title - Predicting Video Game Genres

## Authors
Angie, Edison Fuh

# Description of Question / Research Topic
Can the genre of a video game be predicted by screenshots taken during gameplay? Do the contents of the screenshot change the likelihood of correct identification? What are some other contributing factors to incorrect classification? Are some genres easier to confuse with other genres? What are some of the easiest to identify genres?

# Project Outline / Plan

## Data Collection Plan

### Edison
For higher quality screenshots, I will self-capture data from my own game libraries(s). Each game will have multiple screenshots taken, and proportions of genres should be roughly similar. To fill in spots of the data, screenshots from official promotional material could be used. Additionally, UI screenshots could be taken from longplay-style videos or streams, as they do not usually appear in promotional material or regular videos.
